# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IS THE SYSTEMATIC APPLICATION OF ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES,METHODS AND TOOLS TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTANANCE OF HIGH QUALITY SOFTWRE SYSTEMS

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMING LANGUAGES
ESTABLISHMENT OF SOFTWARE ENGENEERING AS A DISCIPINE
RISE OF AGILE METHODOLOGIES

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
REQUIREMENTS-GATHERING AND DOCUMENTING USER'S NEEDS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
DESIGN-CREATING HIGH LEVEL AND DETAILED DESIGNS OF THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECHTURE AND USER INTERFACE
IMPLEMENTATION-WRITING CODE AND BUILDING ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
TESTING-CONDUCTING VARIOUS TESTS TO ENSURE SOFTWARE MEETS QUALITY STANDARDS AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
DEPLOYMENT-RELEASING THE SOFTWARE TO CUSTOMERS 
MAINTAINANCE-PROVIDING SUPPORT,UPDATES AND ENHANCEMENT TO THE SOFTWARE AFTER DEVELOPMENT

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WHILE IN WATERFALL PHASES MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE NEXT BEGINS,AGILE WORKS IN SHORT CONTINUOS SPRINTS
WATERFALL WORKS WELL IN PROJECTS WITH WELL DEFINED REQUIREMENTS WITH FIXED DEADLINES AND FIXED BUDGETS WHERELSE AGILE WORKS WELL WITH PROJECTS THAT ARE DYNAMIC AND PRONE TO CHANGE

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER-WRITING CODE AND IMPLEMENTING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER-ENSURES SOFTWARE QUALITY BY DESIGNING AND EXECUTING TEST PLANS
PROJECT MANAGER-OVERSEES THE PLANNING;EXECUTE AND DELIVERY OF SOFTWARE PROJECTS

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE TOOLS FOR WRITING,DEBBUGING AND TESTING CODEeg.VISUAL STUDIO
VCS-TRACK CHANGES TO SOURCE CODE AND COORDINATES WORK AMONG TEAM MEMBERSeg.GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
CHANGING REQUIREMENTS-EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
TIGHT DEADLINES-PRIORITIZATION OF TASKS

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING-TESTING INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS
INTERGRATION TESTING- TESTING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMPONENTS
SYSTEM TESTING-TESTING ENTIRE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE
ACEEEPTANCE TESTING-TESTING THE SOFTWRE AGAINST USER REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE IT MEETS USER NEEDS

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
IT REFERS TO CRAFTING QUESTIONS TO GET THE BEST RENSPONSES FROM AI MODELS
IT IS IMPORTANT TO INTERACT WITH AI MODELS AS IT ENSURES EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE USER AND THE MODEL HENCE HENCE APPROPRIATE RESULTS

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT;DRAW A GIRL
DRWA A GIRL WITH A BROWN SKIN COMPLEXION ,CURLY BLONDE EYE WITH PINK SPECTACLES AND A BLUE DRESS,SITTING UNDER A TREE FOLDING HER LEGS WHILE READING A BROWN STORYBOOK
THE SECOND SENTENCE EXPLAINS EXACLTLY HOW THE GIRL LOOKS,WHAT SHE IS WEARING ,WHERE SHE IS AND WHAT SHE IS DOING MAKING THE PROMPT TO GIVE AN EFFICIENT RESULT
